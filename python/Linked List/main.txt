A linked list is composed of multiple nodes, containing 2 things the actual data and the pointer to the next entry in the list
we know that time complexity of it is as follows:-
Operation	Singly Linked List
Access (Get element at index i)	O(n)
Search (Find element with value x)	O(n)
Insert at Head	O(1)
Insert at Tail	O(n) (or O(1))
Insert at Middle	O(n)
Delete at Head	O(1)
Delete at Tail	O(n)
Delete Specific Node (given pointer)	O(n)
